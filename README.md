#Inferential Statistics
- ANOVA, which stands for "analysis of variance," is a statistical test used to assess how a quantitative dependent variable changes based on the levels of one or more categorical independent variables. It aims to determine whether there are significant differences in the means of the groups at each level of the independent variable.
- Linear regression and ANOVA share similarities: both methods break down the total variance of the data into distinct components and assess their equality using the "F" test. They both involve a continuous dependent variable. However, in ANOVA, the independent variable must be exclusively categorical, whereas in regression, both categorical and continuous independent variables are allowed. Therefore, ANOVA can be seen as a special case of linear and multiple regression where all predictors are categorical.
- The null hypothesis (H0) in ANOVA suggests no difference in mean execution time, while the alternate hypothesis (Ha) posits that not all group means are equal.
